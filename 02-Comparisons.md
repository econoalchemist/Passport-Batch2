## Ports
Passport Founders Edition features a single port, the microSD card port. Passport Batch 2 features a microSD card plus an USB-C port to charge the battery. The USB-C port is power-only and cannot transmit data. The microSD card port in Passport Batch 2 has more depth so that the microSD card can be inserted further, whereas the microSD card port on the Passport Founders Edition leaves roughly half the microSD card sticking out.

## Keypads & Screens

The navigation keys on the Passport Batch 2 are copper in color, rectangular for the power & select controls, and square for the up/down/left/right controls. Whereas on the Passport Founders Edition, the power button shares the same key as the delete button. The key to the left of the up/down/left/right controls is dedicated to the shutdown function. The navigation controls on the Passport Founders Edition are more rounded in shape.
