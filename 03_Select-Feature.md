# Passport Batch 2 and Whirlpool
Whirlpool is a zero-link CoinJoin implementation supported by Samourai Wallet on Android mobile devices and by Sparrow Wallet on Linux, Mac, & Windows desktops. Zero-link CoinJoin means that there are no deterministic links between the inputs and outputs of the CoinJoin transaction. Because multiple entities are involved with each CoinJoin, there cannot be any certainty as to which entity owns which transaction output. CoinJoins can be used as a technique to gain anonymity on a public blockchain, putting the decision to selectively reveal details about yourself back in your hands thus giving you a layer of privacy seperating your real-world identity from the transactions on a public ledger. 

Passport supports Whirlpool accounts and this section will demonstrate how to setup and use this feature on Bitcoin Testnet. All the steps are the same for Bitcoin Mainnet. There will be two wallets used in this demonstration; the first is Sparrow Wallet acting as the hot wallet which is the wallet where the CoinJoin transactions will originate from, the second is Passport Batch 2 acting as the cold wallet where the outputs from the hot wallet CoinJoins will be deposited. Using this technique offers a couple benefits. First, each deposit to the Passport Batch 2 will look like every other CoinJoin output to external observers on-chain and therefore no one except for you will know those UTXOs are now in cold storage. So as other CoinJoin participants continue mixing the other UTXOs from your CoinJoin transactions, the anonimity set of your UTXOs in cold storage continues to grow. Another benefit is that the Whirlpool account on Passport was designed in such a way that you can import it to a hot wallet at anytime in the future and continue mixing those UTXOs as free-riders in Whirlpool thus saving yourself from paying the coordinator fees a second time. Understand though that importing the Whirlpool account to a hot wallet exposes the seed to an internet connected device and therefore it is recommended to use a seperate seed on your Passport for any accounts you plan on doing this with.
