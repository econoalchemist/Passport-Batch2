# Self-Custody Made Simple
Self-custody means that you are in control of your private keys, this is how you maintain unrestricted access to your bitcoin. By extension, unrestricted access to your bitcoin means that you can send bitcoin to anyone in the world for any reason at anytime. You don't need anyone's permission, you won't be held against any financial instititution's moral standards, and nobody can stop you from making the transactions that you want to make. 

With great power comes great responsibility however, self-custody also means that you are taking radical responsibility of your bitcoin. You and you alone are responsible for managing your private keys in a way that you can access them but not your adversaries. There is no 1-800 help line, there is no reversing transactions, and there is no one that can help you recover lost or forgotten information. This may sound intimidating or complicated but tools like the Foundation Passport Batch-2 make self-custody very simple and easy to manage. 

## Unboxing the Passport Batch-2
Passport Batch-2 is shipped in a nondescript white box. There will be a shipping label (peeled off for privacy reasons) and a blue tamper-evident seal on the outside of the box. The tamper-evident seal will be placed over the opening flap of the box and the seal will have a number on it that starts with `B799`, `B862`, or `B863`. The full-length unique numbers are not saved by Foundation Devices but the prefix is used to identify the production batch the device was manufactured in. You can find a maintained list of these prefixes [here](https://docs.foundationdevices.com/passport/setup).

* Privacy Tip: Consider using a PO Box and an alias to avoid connecting your personally identifiable information to Bitcoin related items.
* Security Tip: If the security seal shows any signs of tampering, contact mailto:hello@foundationdevices.com
